# ComfyUI to InvokeAI

If you're coming to InvokeAI from ComfyUI, welcome! You'll find things are similar but different - the good news is that you already know how things should work, and it's just a matter of wiring them up! 

Some things to note: 

- InvokeAI's nodes tend to be more granular than default nodes in Comfy. This means each node in Invoke will do a specific task and you might need to use multiple nodes to achieve the same result. The added granularity improves the control you have have over your workflows. 
- InvokeAI's backend and ComfyUI's backend are very different and Comfy workflows are not able to be imported into InvokeAI. However, we have created a list of popular workflows for you to get started with Nodes in InvokeAI!
